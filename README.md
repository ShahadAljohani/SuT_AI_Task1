# SuT_AI_Task1

Trained an image recognition model using Teachable Machine by Google.

The model was trained on a simple dataset containing two animal classes: cats and owls.

When a barn owl image was imported, the model predicted it as an owl with 100% accuracy.

----------
### Next step:
I wrote the code in Google Colab, as found in the files `AI_Task1_SuT.ipynb` and `SuT_AI_Task1_Code.txt`.
- First, i installed TensorFlow version 2.12.1 since it is compatible with Teachable Machine models and prevents compatibilty errors.
- Then, I updated the image path.
- Upon running the model, the output showed a **confidence score of 0.9999958**, classifying the image as **Owl**
